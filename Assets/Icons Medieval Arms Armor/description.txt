- icons are provided as individual PNG files

This icon set is made up of medieval weapons and armor which are more-or-less realistic and inspired by historical designs. Mostly. If I expand it, it'll probably branch out into more medieval-fantasy directions, though with a generally grounded aesthetic.

Feel free to email me and suggest more icons if you have any ideas! I have a few ideas myself, and have plans to create icon sets for other themes & genres.
